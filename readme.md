# Express Router with MongoDB Queries

This project demonstrates the usage of Express.js Router along with MongoDB queries to interact with a MongoDB database using Mongoose. The code includes various routes for performing CRUD operations and querying MongoDB documents.

## How It Works

### Components:
- **Express.js Router**: A module used to define middleware and routes in a modular manner in an Express application.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a schema-based solution for modeling application data.

### Functionality:

1. **Flash Messages (commented out)**:
   - Flash messages functionality is provided but commented out. It typically involves displaying temporary messages to users on certain events like successful login, error, etc.

2. **Intermediate MongoDB Operations (commented out)**:
   - Several MongoDB operations are demonstrated through commented-out routes. These operations include:
     - Creating a document in the database.
     - Finding documents based on case-insensitive username matching.
     - Finding documents containing specific categories.
     - Finding documents within a specified date range.
     - Finding documents where the "categories" field exists.

3. **Find Data Based on Field**:
   - This route demonstrates finding documents where the "categories" field exists. It uses the `exists` operator provided by MongoDB.

## Purpose of Code

The purpose of this code is to showcase the usage of Express Router along with Mongoose for interacting with a MongoDB database. Each route corresponds to a specific MongoDB operation, such as creating, querying, updating, or deleting documents. These operations are commonly used in web applications for handling data persistence.

## Usage

To use this code:
1. Ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally.
2. Modify the MongoDB connection details in the `users.js` file if necessary.
3. Uncomment the desired routes in the `routes.js` file to perform the corresponding MongoDB operations.
4. Run the Express application and access the routes defined in the `routes.js` file to execute the MongoDB operations.
